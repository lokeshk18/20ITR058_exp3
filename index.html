    <p>Epoch is an inter college event organised by the Information Technology department in Kongu Engineering College .We believe that the Indian youth have the power and energy to make it the abode of vivacity, inspiration, and creation and thus we strive to create the perfect platform for such edgy minds with disruptive ideas that have the potential to enable better lives.
        Our flagship event, The Epoch, currently in its 15th edition and continues to inspire countless ideas, expedite innovative startups and a jam-packed cluster of events designed for everyone.
        This year, the epoch sets out to champion the maniacs and misfits that refused the routine and achieved breakthroughs. With a digital environment filled with energetic individuals, the Epoch 2021 on the 10th of April aims to accelerate these ideas through the stratosphere.
        Because we know that great ideas are hard to come by! </p>
